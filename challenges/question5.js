///****** Add to comments - notes *****************

// 1. Reduce list of transactions into a Map by using the "category" as a key &  "amount" as value.
// 2. Once we have a Map, we can grab the entries, map them into objects with a "category" & "total" key-value pair.
// 3. Filter the objects by their "total" as it compares to the " threshold". If no threshold, show all transactions. If threshold --> show only those transactions which ar above or equal to the threshold.
// 4. Sort them by total (descending), as instructed.
// 5. Slice the result to return top three spending categories if threshold is missing or return undefined.
